A collaborative SLAM system is the work of, where the
system is designed to work with multiple hand-held devices equipped with either
a monocular camera and IMU or stereo camera pair, along with a mobile phone or
autonomous robot for network and computing capabilities. Each agent performs
full SLAM on board, and a centralized server is used for storing and sharing
maps between agents.  However, this system exhibits few other collaborative
features, for one it does not perform a global optimization of the maps created
by different agents, nor are the map optimization work load shared amongst
other agents or server.
