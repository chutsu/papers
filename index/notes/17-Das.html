Although Multi-Camera Clusters are capable of performing accuracte
location in a variety of environemnts a major disadvantage to date is that
they require a fixed calibration between cameras to provide the solution
at the correct scale. The fixed extrinsic calibration of the cluster
places many limitations on MCC performance.

1. Any camera cluster must be recalibrated if a new configuration is
   required

2. Since MCC is fixed to the vehicle frame, the observation viewpoints of
   the cameras are highly dependent on the vehicle motion. The coupking of
   the vehicle motion and camera observation viewpoints is especially
   problematic if the vehicle undergoes motions which make the vision
   solution degereate, or if the vehicle motion results in teh camera
   cluster observing areas of low texture where only poor feature
   measurments are possible.

In this work Das proposes a calibration procedure which will enable the
estimation of time varying extrinsic calibration for MCC. The calbration
procedure then determines the parameers of the system, such that the
transformation between cameras can be computed using the control inputs ot
the mechancisms. Using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention, a kinematic
transform chain is formulated which describes the transformation between
a static and actuated camera, then with visual data from a fiducial target
to estimate the DH parameters of the mechanism.

The class of calibration methods related to our problem is known as
kinematic calibration, and seeks to refine the forward kinematic
parameters of robotic manipulators in order to improve overall end
effector positioning performance. Generally, the kinematic paramters are
optimized by comparing the motion of the end effector to the predicted
motion of the mechanism given the froward kinematic parameters and teh
joint angles.
