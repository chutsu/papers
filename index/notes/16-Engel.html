## Direct vs Indirect

Underlying all formulations is a probabilistic model that takes noisy
measurements $Y$ as input and computes an estimator $X$ for the unknown,
hidden model parameters (3D world model and camera motion). Typically
a Maximum Likelihood approach is used, which finds the model parameters
that maximize the probability of obtaining the actual measurements.

Indirect methods then proceed in two steps. First raw sensor measurements
are pre-processed to generate an intermediate representation, solving part
of the overall problem such as establishing correspondences. Second, the
computed intermediate values are interpreted as noisy measurements $Y$ in
a probabilistic model to estimate geometry and camera motion.

Direct methods skip the pre-processing step and directly use the actual
sensor values - light received from a certain direction over a certain
time period - as measurements $Y$ in probabilistic model.

In the case of passive vision, direct approach thus optimizes
a photometric error, since the sensor provides photometric measurements.
Indirect methods on the other hand optimize a geometric error, since the
pre-computed values point-positions or flow-vectors are geometric
quantities.

## Dense vs Sparse

Sparse methods use and reconstruct only a selected set of independent
points (traditionally corners), where as dense methods attempt to use and
reconstruct all pixel sin the 2D image domain. Intermediate approaches
(semi-dense) refrain from reconstructing the complete surface, but still
aim at using and reconstructing a largely connected and well constrained
subset.

Apart from the extent of the used image region however, a more fundamental
and consequential difference lies in the addition of a geometry prior. In
the sparse formulation, there is no notion of neighborhood, and geometry
parameters (keypoint positions) are conditionally independent given the
camera poses and intrinsics. Dense (or semi-dense) approaches on the other
hand exploit the connectedness of the used image region to formulate
a geometry prior, typically favouring smoothness. In fact such a prior is
formulated directly in the form of an additional log-likelihood energy
term.

- Sparse + Indirect: Most widely used formulation, estimating 3D geometry
from a set of keypoint matches, thereby uisng a geometric error without
a geometry prior. (monoSLAM, PTAM, ORB-SLAM)

- Dense + Indirect: Estimates 3D geometry from or in conjunction with
a dense regularized optical flow field, thereby combining a geometric
error (deviation from the flow field) with a geometry prior (smoothness of
the flow field).

- Dense + Direct: Employs a photometric error as well as a geometric prior
to estimate dense or semi-dense geometry. (DTAM, LSD-SLAM)

- Sparse + Direct: Optimizes a photometric error defined directly on the
images, without incorporating a geometric prior.

This paper proposes a Sparse + Direct formulation that optimizes
a photometric error defined directly on the image images, without
incorporating a geometric prior.

- main drawback of adding a geometry prior is the introduction of
  correlations between geometry parameters, which render a statistically
  consistent joint optimization in real time infeasible. This is why
  existing dense or semi-dense approaches


## Contribution

- proposes a sparse and direct approach to monocular visual odometry fully
direct method that jointly optimizes the full likelihood for all involved
model parameters, including camera poses, camera intrinsics and geometry
parameters (inverse depth values).

- further takes advantage of photometric camera calibration, including
lens attenuation, gamma correction and known exposure times. This
integrated photometric calibration further increases accuracy and
robustness.
