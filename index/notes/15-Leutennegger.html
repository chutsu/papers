Presented a novel approach to tightly integrate visual measurements with
readings from an IMU for SLAM. An IMU error term is integrated with the
landmark reprojection error in a fully probabilistic manner, resulting in
a joint non-linear cost function to be optimized. Employing the power
concept of keyframes they partially marginalize old states to maintain
a bounded-sized optimization window, ensuring real-time operation.

[Strasdat2010] showed that in purely visual SLAM optimization based
approaches provide better accuracy for the same computational work when
compared to filtering approaches. Maintaining a relatively sparse graph of
keyframes and their associated landmarks subject to non-linear
optimization.

Contributions:

1. Employ keyframe paradigm for drift-free estimation also when slow or
   no-motion at all is present: rather than using an optimization window
   of time-successive poses, keyframes are kept.

2. Provide a fully probabilistic derivation of IMU error terms, including
   the respective information matrix, relating successive image frames
   without explicitly introducing states at the IMU-rate.

3. At the system level, the authors developed both hardware and algorithms
   needed for accurate real-time SLAM, including robust keypoint matching
   and outlier rejection using inertial cues.
