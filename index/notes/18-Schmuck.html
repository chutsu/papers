Collaborative centralized multi-agent SLAM (CCM-SLAM) The
system was designed to fuse data streams from multiple monocular cameras on
board multiple MAVs. Each MAV runs a visual odometry system for autonomy, and
offloads the computationally intensive tasks back to the central server. All
information between the MAVs and the central server are shared, for example if
an agent visits an area of the environment previously visited by another agent,
previous experiences are retrieved from the server. Finally, the server detects
and removes redundant data without compromising the robustness of the
estimation.
