# High Precision, Consistent EKF-based Visual-Inertial Odometry

In contrast to EKF-SLAM, MSCKF is an EKF algorithm that maintains in its
state vector a sliding window of poses, and uses feature observations to
impose probabilistic constraints between these poses.

IMU measurements are used to propagate the IMU state estimate and the
filter covariance matrix, simlar to EKF SLAM. The difference lies in teh
way in which the feature measurements are used, specifically every time
a new image is recorded by the camera, the MSCKF state and convariance are
augmented witha copy of the current IMU pose, and the image is processed
to extract and match features. Each feature is tracked until all its
meaurements become available (e.g. until it goes out of field of view), at
which time an update is carried out using all the measurements
simultaneously.
