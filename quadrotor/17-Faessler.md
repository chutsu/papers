Thrust Mixing, Saturation, and Body-Rate Control for Accurate Aggressive
Quadrotor Flight

- Novel body-rate controller using LQR methods, whcih takes the dynamics of
each motors with propellers into account.
- Improve computation of each rotor thrusts such that the desired yaw torque on
the quadrotor body, given by a feedback controller is reached more precisely
than with state-of-the-art methods.
- Increase quadrotor stability and robustness in case of motor-input
saturations by applying a saturation scheme for each rotor thrusts
