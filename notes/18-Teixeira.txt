Argued that a collaborative relative pose estimation is required to enable MAV
flights close to structures that may have insufficient texture near or on the
target. The proposed method uses a master and slave architecture, where the
slave MAV is positioned close to the target structure, and the master MAV
acting as a reference to the slave is positioned further away. The master is
retrofitted with a known constellation of LED markers in order for the slave
MAV to estimate the relative pose.
