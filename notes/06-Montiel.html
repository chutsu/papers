An issue with monocular slam has been the intialization, since information from
multiple images acquired during motion must be combined to achieve accurate
depth estimates. This has led algorithms to deviate from desirable Gaussian
uncertainty representation of the probabilistic filters. In this paper, a
inverse parameterization is introduced which permits efficient and accurate
representation of uncertainty during undelayed initalization and beyond all
within the standard EKF. The key concept is direct parameterization of inverse
depth, where there is a high degree of linearity.  Importantly, the
parameterization can cope with features which are far from the camera (little
parallax during motion).
