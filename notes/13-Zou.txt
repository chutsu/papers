CoSLAM obtains multiple monocular camera streams as input, and groups cameras
using a place recognition module. The disadvantage of this system are, first,
all cameras need to be synchronized.  Secondly, to initialize the SLAM systems
all cameras must observe the same scene. Lastly, the processing of all data
requires a graphics processing unit (GPU) to run at real time.
