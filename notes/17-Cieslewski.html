Proposes a method that requires a similar amount of data exchange between
agents as a centralized approach without precluding any matches. This is
achieved by pre-assigning visual bag-of-words vocabulary to different robots,
and obtaining a candidate selection to choose which robot to send the full
query. Both works were validated in simulation only.

A rapid exploration method for a MAV in an unknown environment is devised. The
core contribution of this work lies in maintaining a constant velocity while
exploring an unknown environment, thereby reducing the amount of wasted energy
hovering in place. During outdoor experiments, however, they experienced
frequent visual odometry failures due to lighting conditions and sudden
quadrotor attitude changes.
